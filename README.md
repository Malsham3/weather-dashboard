# weather-dashboard
The goal of this project is to help provide an easy and simple to use weather forecast webpage to those who travel often, so they can plan ahead of time.
Users/ travelers are one click away from viewing the weather for today, and the next five days. All that's needed is a valid name of a city, which can be international too! Below is a break down of the web application. 

Current weather stats: 
    - Show today's day and date.
    - Temperature in Fahrenheit fixed to two decimal places.
    - Humidaty precentage.
    - Wind speed in miles per hour.
    - UV index, which is color coded based on it's level.

In the 5-Day Forecast section, each day has it's own card which include:
    - The date
    - Temperature in Fahrenheit fixed to two decimal places.
    - Humidity precentage.

The Search History section stores previously searched cities, include up to 5 searches that are read only to remind the user what they have looked up previously. The cities remain present even after a page load for the user's convenience of not losing the search history data.

With the features discussed above, users / travelers have easy access to weather stats for a given city. The web application is responsive and is displayed appropriately on any smart device.
