## Project description
The goal of this project is to build a simple, responsive, and easy to use web application that allows users to view weather forecast for major cities worldwide. This web application was built with frequent commuters / travelers in mind hoping to help them plan ahead.
Users/ travelers are one click away from viewing the weather for today, and the next five days.

## Usage
Using Weather Dashboard is fairly simple. 
You are first welcomed with a welcome message and today's day/date. To the left is the search history section if you are a returning user.
Look up the desired city of choice in the text box in the top right corner and click search (or press Enter.)
The welcome message in the right card is then replaced with today's weather forecast for that city. 

### Today's weather stats include: 
- Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- Humidity (percentage)
- Wind speed (in MPH)
- Ultraviolet radiation exposure (UV Index)

### 5-day weather stats include:
- The date of each day
- Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
- Humidity (percentage)
... more to come!
